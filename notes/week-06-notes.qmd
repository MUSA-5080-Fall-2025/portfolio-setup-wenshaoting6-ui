# Limitations of Linear Models

## 1. What Does This Model Ignore?
- **Location matters!** (North End vs. Roxbury vs. Back Bay)  
- Proximity to downtown, waterfront, parks  
- Nearby crime levels  
- School quality  
- Neighborhood characteristics  

## 2. Why Might It Fail?
- 1,000 sq ft in **Back Bay ‚â† Roxbury**  
- Same house, different locations ‚Üí vastly different prices  
- ‚Äú**Location, location, location!**‚Äù

## 3. How Could We Improve It?
- Add **spatial features** (crime nearby, distance to amenities)  
- Control for **neighborhood** (fixed effects)  
- Include **interactions** (e.g., does size matter more in wealthy areas?)

> üí° **Key idea:** This is exactly where *spatial features* come in!

# Converting to Spatial Data

1. **Make your data spatial**  
   Convert tabular data (with coordinates) into an `sf` object.  

2. **Spatial join with neighborhoods**  
   Match each property to a neighborhood polygon.

# Beyond Continuous Variables

| Type | Examples |
|------|-----------|
| **Continuous Variables** | Square footage, Age of house, Income levels, Distance to downtown |
| **Categorical Variables** | Neighborhood, School district, Building type, Has garage? (Yes/No) |

# Interaction Effects: When Relationships Depend

### The Question
> Does the effect of one variable depend on the level of another variable?

### Example Scenarios
- **Housing:** Does square footage matter more in wealthy neighborhoods?  
- **Education:** Do tutoring effects vary by initial skill level?  
- **Public Health:** Do pollution effects differ by age?

# Policy Implications

## What This Tells Us About Boston‚Äôs Housing Market

### 1. Market Segmentation
Boston operates as **two distinct housing markets**:
- **Luxury market:** Every sq ft is premium (~$1081/sq ft)  
- **Standard market:** Space valued, but lower premium (~$96/sq ft)

### 2. Affordability Crisis
- The interaction **amplifies inequality**  
- Large homes in wealthy areas become **exponentially more expensive**  
- Creates **barriers to mobility** between neighborhoods  

### 3. Policy Design
- **One-size-fits-all policies** may fail  
- Property tax assessments should **account for neighborhood-specific valuation**  
- **Housing assistance** needs vary dramatically by area

# When *Not* to Use Interactions
- **Small samples:** Need enough data in each group  
- **Overfitting:** Too many interactions make models unstable

# Theory: The U-Shaped Age Effect

### Step 1: Linear Model (Baseline)
\[
\text{Price} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Age} + \varepsilon
\]

### Step 2: Add Polynomial Term
\[
\text{Price} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Age} + \beta_2 \text{Age}^2 + \varepsilon
\]

# Tobler‚Äôs First Law of Geography
> ‚ÄúEverything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.‚Äù

# Three Approaches to Spatial Features

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Buffer Aggregation
Count or sum events within a defined distance.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
Average distance to *k* closest events.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Distance to Specific Points
Compute straight-line distance to important locations (e.g., downtown, parks).

---

# What Are Fixed Effects?

**Fixed Effects** = Categorical variables that capture all unmeasured characteristics of a group.  
They help control for differences **within** vs. **between** areas (e.g., neighborhoods, cities).

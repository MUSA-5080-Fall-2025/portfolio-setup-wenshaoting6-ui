## **Anscombe's Quartet**
> *Four datasets with identical summary statistics can reveal completely different patterns when visualized.*

**Why this matters:**
- Summary statistics can hide critical patterns.
- Outliers may represent important or vulnerable communities.
- Relationships arenâ€™t always linear.
- Visual inspection reveals potential data quality issues.

## **Ethical Data Communication**
Principles to follow:
- Create **honest, transparent visualizations**.
- Always **assess and communicate data quality**.
- Consider **who might be harmed** by uncertain or misleading data.

**Common problems in government data presentation:**
- Misleading scales or axes.
- Cherry-picked time periods.
- Hidden or ignored uncertainty.
- Lack of context about data reliability.

## **Census Data Considerations**
- **Block Groups:**  
  - Higher *Margins of Error (MOE)* due to smaller populations.
- **Census Tracts:**  
  - Lower *MOE* because they cover larger populations.

> **Key takeaway:** The smaller the population sample, the higher the uncertainty.

## **`ggplot2` Basics**
Structure for building visualizations:

```r
g <- ggplot(data) +
  aes(x = , y = ) + 
  geom_...()

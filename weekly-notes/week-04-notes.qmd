## Geographic Bias in Algorithms

- Training data may **underrepresent certain areas**
- **Spatial autocorrelation** violates the independence assumption
- **Service delivery algorithms** may reinforce existing geographic inequities

## Spatial Data Fundamentals

### Vector Data Model

- **Points:** Locations (e.g., schools, hospitals, crime incidents)  
- **Lines:** Linear features (e.g., roads, rivers, transit routes)  
- **Polygons:** Areas (e.g., census tracts, neighborhoods, service areas)

Each spatial feature includes:
- **Geometry** (shape and location)  
- **Attributes** (descriptive data)

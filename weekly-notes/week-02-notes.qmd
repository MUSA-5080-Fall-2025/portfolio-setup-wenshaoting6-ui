## What is an Algorithm?

A **set of rules or instructions** for solving a problem or completing a task.

**Examples:**
- A recipe for cooking
- Directions to get somewhere
- A decision tree for hiring

---

## Algorithmic Decision-Making in Government

- Systems used to **assist or replace human decision-makers**
- Based on **predictions from models** that process historical data

**Key components:**
- **Inputs (X):** features, predictors, independent variables  
- **Outputs (Y):** labels, outcomes, dependent variables

---

## Real-World Applications

- **Criminal justice**
- **Housing finance**
- **Healthcare**

**Key trade-offs and issues:**
- **Statistical bias:** A group cannot represent an individual perfectly  
- **Data collection bias:** Data might be collected with systemic biases

---

## History of Government Data Collection

- Civic registration systems  
- Decennial census data  
- Administrative records  
- Post-WWII operations research

**What’s new today:**
- Larger quantities of data  
- Focus on **prediction rather than explanation**  
- Harder to interpret and explain decisions

---

## Why Governments Use Algorithmic Systems

Governments face **limited budgets** but must serve everyone. Algorithms provide:

- **Efficiency** – faster processing  
- **Consistency** – standardizing decisions  
- **Objectivity** – reducing individual judgment  
- **Cost savings**

---

## Human Choices in Every Step

Even automated systems **embed human values and biases**, including decisions about:

- Data cleaning  
- Data coding or classification  
- Data collection (often uses imperfect proxies)  
- Variable selection in models  
- Interpretation of results

---

## Example: Healthcare Algorithm Bias

**Problem:**
- A healthcare algorithm systematically **discriminated against Black patients**.

**Why it happened:**
- The model used **healthcare costs as a proxy for need**.
- Due to systemic inequities in access, **Black patients incurred lower costs**.
- Result: Black patients were **under-prioritized**, even with equivalent illness levels.

## Census Data Types

| Census Product      | Key Features |
|--------------------|--------------|
| **Decennial Census** | Conducted every 10 years; complete count of the population |
| **ACS 1-Year Estimates** | For areas with population **>65,000**; most current data, smaller sample |
| **ACS 5-Year Estimates** | For **all areas** (including census tracts); most reliable data, largest sample, includes MOE |

---

## Using Census Data in R

- **`tidycensus`** package for R  
- Two main data types:
  - **Summary tables** (aggregated statistics)
  - **PUMS** (Public Use Microdata Sample, individual records)

**TIGER/Line files:**  
- Provide **geographic boundaries** (shapefiles) for mapping.

---

## Historical Census Data Sources

- **NHGIS** – Historical census data  
- **Neighborhood Change Database (NCDB)**  
- **Longitudinal Tract Database (LTDB)** – Tracks changes over time

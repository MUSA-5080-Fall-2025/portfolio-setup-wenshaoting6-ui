What is an algorithm?
  A set of rules or instructions for solving a problem or compkenting a task
  Ex: Reciper for cooking
      Direction to get somewhere
      Decision tree for hiring
      
Algorithmic Decision making in government
  Systems used to assist or replace human decision-makers
  based on predictions from models that process historical data containing:
  Inputs (EX:features, predictors, independent variabke, x)
  Outputs(EX:labels, outcome, depent variavble, y)

Real World ex:
 criminal justice
 housing finance
 healthcare
 tradeoff: statistical bisas: a group cannot represent an individual
           data collection bias: data could be collected with bias

history of data collection
  civic registeration system
  census data
  administrative records
  operation research (Post WWII)
What's new?
  More data
  Focus on prediction rather than explanitaiton
  Harder to interpret and explain

Why gov use them
-Have limited budgets and need to serve everyone
  Efficiency
  Consistency
  Objectivity
  Cost savings

Every steps involve human choices
  Data cleaning process
  Data coding or classification
  Data collection-use of imperfect proxies
  How you interpret results
  What variable you put on the model
These choices embed human values and biases

Healthcare Algorithm Bias
  Systematically discriminated againest black patients
  Problem
    use healthcare costs as a proxy for need 
    black patients incur lower costs due to systemic inequities in access
    black patients under prioritized despite equivalent level of illness

Decennial Census vs. ACS Census

ACS 1 year
(area>65,000 pop), most current, smallest sample

ACS 5 year (all areas including census tract)
most reliable data, largest sample (MOE)

R tidycensus

summary table v.s. pums (individual record)

tiger/line files
geographic boundaries (shapefiles)

historical data sources
NHGIS-historical census data
neightborhood change database
lingitudinal tract database-track change over time

Does it solve the problems?\n\n---\n\n# Opening Thought {.center}\n\n**Before we discuss HOW to build predictive policing systems, we need to ask: SHOULD we?**\n\n*\"A statistically 'good' model can still be socially harmful.\"*\n\n- Richardson, Schultz & Crawford (2019)\n\n---\n\n# Today's Critical Questions\n\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Technical Questions:**\n\n- How do we model crime counts?\n- What spatial features predict crime?\n- How do we validate predictions?\n- Can we outperform baseline methods?\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Critical Questions:**\n\n- Whose data? Whose crimes?\n- What if the data is \"dirty\"?\n- Who benefits? Who is harmed?\n- What feedback loops are created?\n- Can technical solutions fix social problems?\n:::\n::::\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## Today's Approach\nWe will learn the technical methods AND critically interrogate their use. Both skills are essential for ethical data science.\n:::\n\n---\n\n# Part 1: The Seductive Promise of Predictive Policing {.center}\n\n---\n\n## The Sales Pitch\n\n**What vendors and police departments claim:**\n\n- **Efficiency:** \"Deploy limited resources where they're needed most\"\n- **Objectivity:** \"Remove human bias from decision-making\"  \n- **Proactivity:** \"Prevent crime before it happens\"\n- **Data-driven:** \"Let the data tell us where crime will occur\"\n\n**Sounds great, right?**\n\n. . .\n\n**But these claims rest on critical assumptions:**\n\n1. That crime data accurately reflects crime (it doesn't)\n2. That past patterns predict future crime (they might just predict policing)\n3. That we can separate \"good\" from \"bad\" data (we often can't)\n4. That technical solutions can fix social problems (they can't)\n\n---\n\n## The Technical Evolution\n\n| Generation | Method | Data Used | Example |\n|------------|--------|-----------|---------|\n| **1st:** Hotspots | Kernel Density | Past crime locations | KDE maps |\n| **2nd:** Risk Terrain | Logistic Reg. | Crime + features | RTM software |\n| **3rd:** ML | Random Forest, Neural Nets | Everything | PredPol, Palantir |\n| **4th:** Person-Based | Network analysis | Social connections | Strategic Subject List |\n\n**Each generation claims to be more \"objective\" and \"accurate\"**\n\nBut what if they're all built on the same flawed foundation?\n\n---\n\n# Part 2: The Dirty Data Problem {.center}\n\n---\n\n## What Is \"Dirty Data\"?\n\n**Traditional definition** (data mining):\n\n- Missing data\n- Incorrect data  \n- Non-standardized formats\n\n**Extended definition** (Richardson et al. 2019):\n\n> \"Data derived from or influenced by **corrupt, biased, and unlawful practices**, including data that has been intentionally manipulated or 'juked,' as well as data that is distorted by individual and societal biases.\"\n\n---\n\n## The Many Forms of Dirty Data\n\n**1. Fabricated/Manipulated Data**\n\n- False arrests (planted evidence)\n- Downgraded crime classifications to \"juke the stats\"\n- Pressuring victims not to file reports\n\n**2. Systematically Biased Data**\n\n- Over-policing of certain communities → more recorded \"crime\"\n- Under-policing of white-collar crime → appears less common\n- Racial profiling → disproportionate stops/arrests\n\n**3. Missing/Incomplete Data**\n\n- Unreported crimes (especially in over-policed areas with low police trust)\n- Ignored complaints\n- Incomplete records\n\n**4. Proxy Problems**\n\n- Arrests ≠ crimes committed\n- Calls for service ≠ actual need\n- Gang database ≠ actual gang membership\n\n---\n\n## Case Study 1: \"Juking the Stats\" - The Wire and Baltimore\n\n**From TV to Reality:**\n\n*The Wire* (2004): \"If the crime rate doesn't fall, you most certainly will\"\n\n**Baltimore Reality (2008-2018):**\n\n- 14,000+ serious assaults misrecorded as minor offenses\n- Extensive Gun Trace Task Force corruption\n- Officers robbing residents, planting evidence\n- False arrests, fabricated reports\n- Data manipulation to show \"success\"\n\n**Result:** 55+ potential lawsuits, thousands of convictions questioned\n\n**Question:** What happens when this data trains a predictive algorithm?\n\n---\n\n## Case Study 2: CompStat and NYPD\n\n**The Promise:** Data-driven accountability, crime reduction\n\n**The Reality Revealed:**\n\n- 100+ retired NYPD captains surveyed: **Intense pressure led to stat manipulation**\n- Serious crimes downgraded to meet targets\n- Officers planting drugs to meet arrest quotas\n- Commanders persuading victims not to file reports\n\n**The Dual Strategy:**\n\n1. **Downgrade serious crimes** (reported to FBI) → claim success\n2. **Increase minor arrests** (stops, summonses) → show \"control\"\n\n**2013: Independent audit confirmed systematic data problems**\n\n---\n\n## The Feedback Loop Diagram\n\n**The Confirmation Bias Loop:**\n\n- Algorithm learns: \"Crime happens in neighborhood X\"\n- Police sent to neighborhood X\n- More arrests in neighborhood X (regardless of actual crime)  \n- Algorithm \"confirmed\": \"We were right about neighborhood X!\"\n- Cycle intensifies\n\n---\n\n# Part 3: Technical Fixes Can't Solve Social Problems {.center}\n\n---\n\n## Vendor Claims About Bias Mitigation\n\n**PredPol claims:**\n\n> \"Uses ONLY 3 data points—crime type, crime location, and crime date/time\"\n\n**HunchLab claims:**\n\n> \"We would not use data that relates people to predict places—no arrests, no social media, no gang status\"\n\n**Both exclude:** Arrest data, stop data, traffic stops\n\n**Both include:** Crime reports, calls for service\n\n---\n\n## Why \"Cleaning\" The Data Isn't Enough\n\n**Problem 1: Crime reports reflect police decisions**\n\n- Officer decides what to investigate\n- Officer decides what to classify as \"crime\"  \n- Officer decides what to document\n\n**Problem 2: Calls for service reflect community bias**\n\n- Neighbors calling police on Black people barbecuing\n- \"Suspicious activity\" = person of color in \"wrong\" neighborhood\n- Gentrification → increased 311 calls on existing residents\n\n**Problem 3: What counts as \"clean\" data?**\n\n- If drug arrests are racially biased, exclude them ✓\n- But isn't burglary enforcement also biased? What about assault?\n- Where do you draw the line?\n\n---\n\n## The Impossibility of Neutral Crime Data\n\n**Crime data is ALWAYS:**\n\n1. **Socially constructed** - Societies define what counts as \"crime\"\n2. **Selectively enforced** - More resources to some neighborhoods\n3. **Organizationally filtered** - Police priorities, department culture\n4. **Politically shaped** - \"Tough on crime\" eras, moral panics\n5. **Technically mediated** - 911 systems, CAD software, databases\n\n**There is no \"view from nowhere\"**\n\nCrime data doesn't reveal \"crime\" - it reveals **policing patterns**\n\n---\n\n## Comparison: What Gets Policed vs. What Gets Committed\n\n| Type | Frequency | Policing Intensity | In Predictive Models? |\n|------|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| **Violent Crime** | Moderate | High | ✓ Yes |\n| **Property Crime** | High | High | ✓ Yes |\n| **Drug Offenses** | Very High | Racially Disparate | Some exclude |\n| **White-Collar Crime** | **Very High** | **Very Low** | ✗ Rarely |\n| **Wage Theft** | **Exceeds all robbery** | **Almost None** | ✗ Never |\n| **Corporate Fraud** | **$300B+ annually** | **Minimal** | ✗ Never |\n\n**Question:** What would predictive policing look like if we predicted white-collar crime with the same intensity?\n\nSee: [White Collar Crime Risk Zones](https://whitecollar.thenewinquiry.com/) - A satirical map\n\n---\n\n## The \"Missing\" Data Problem\n\n**What crime data DOESN'T capture:**\n\n- Less than **half** of violent crimes reported to police (DOJ estimates)\n- Even fewer property crimes reported\n- Groups with less favorable views of police **less likely to report**\n- Crimes in areas with low police presence go unrecorded\n\n**Example - LAPD 2005-2012:**\n\n- **14,000 serious assaults** misclassified as minor offenses\n- Error not discovered until 2015\n- LAPD already working with PredPol by then\n- **Was this data used?** No evidence either way.\n\n**If you can't trust the labels, you can't trust the model.**\n\n---\n\n# Part 4: Consequences and Harms {.center}\n\n---\n\n## Who Bears the Costs?\n\n:::

cause\n- Trauma, stress\n- Missed opportunities (late to work, etc.)\n- Normalized surveillance\n\n**Cost to communities:**\n\n- Broken trust with police\n- Reduced reporting of actual crimes\n- Economic harm (businesses avoid area)\n- Quality of life degradation\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**False Negatives (Predicted Low Risk, Crime Occurs)**\n\n**Cost to individuals:**\n\n- Inadequate police response\n- Victimization\n- Property loss\n- Safety concerns\n\n**Cost to communities:**\n\n- Unequal protection\n- Perception of being \"written off\"\n- Actual under-policing\n\n**Who experiences each?**\n\n- FP: Predominantly Black/Brown communities\n- FN: Also often Black/Brown communities (just different ones)\n:::\n:::\n\n---\n\n# Part 5: Can Reform Work? {.center}\n\n---\n\n## What Consent Decrees Cover (And Don't Cover)\n\n**Typical Reforms Required:**\n\n- Training on constitutional policing\n- Early intervention systems for problem officers\n- Revised use-of-force policies\n- Community oversight\n- Data collection improvements\n\n**What They DON'T Typically Address:**\n\n- **Historical data** generated during unconstitutional periods\n- **Ongoing use** of that data in algorithms\n- **Data sharing** with other jurisdictions\n- **Vendor accountability** for bias mitigation\n- **Public transparency** about predictive systems\n\n---\n\n## The Chicago Consent Decree (2019)\n\n**What it includes:**\n\n- CPD must collect better data\n- Community oversight board\n- Constitutional policing training\n- Use of force reforms\n\n**What community organizations noted is MISSING:**\n\n- No restrictions on use of SSL\n- No prohibition on using data from 2011-2017 (period of documented violations)\n- No requirements for predictive policing oversight\n- Limited transparency about algorithms\n\n**In 2019:** CPD contracted with UChicago Crime Lab to \"update\" predictive approaches\n\n**Question:** Using which data?\n\n---\n\n# Part 6: A Framework for Critical Evaluation {.center}\n\n---\n\n## Questions to Ask About Any Predictive Policing System\n\n### 1. **Data Provenance**\n\n- What time period does training data cover?\n- Were there civil rights investigations during that period?\n- Were there documented cases of data manipulation?\n- What evidence exists that data is accurate?\n\n### 2. **Variable Selection**\n\n- What specific variables are used?\n- How might each variable embed bias?\n- What's excluded and why?\n- Who made these choices?\n\n---\n\n## Questions (Continued)\n\n### 3. **Validation**\n\n- How is accuracy measured?\n- What counts as \"success\"?\n- Are error rates reported by neighborhood?\n- Who experiences false positives vs. false negatives?\n\n### 4. **Deployment**\n\n- How do predictions translate to action?\n- What discretion do officers have?\n- Are social services actually offered?\n- What are the measurable outcomes?\n\n---\n\n## Questions (Continued)\n\n### 5. **Transparency & Accountability**\n\n- Is the methodology public?\n- Can community members access their own \"risk scores\"?\n- Is there a process to challenge predictions?\n- Who monitors for disparate impact?\n\n### 6. **Alternatives**\n\n- What non-punitive interventions were considered?\n- Could these resources address root causes instead?\n- What would actual community safety investment look like?\n\n---\n\n## The Fundamental Question\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false}\n## Before Asking \"Does It Work?\", Ask:\n\n**\"Should we be doing this at all?\"**\n\nConsider:\n\n- A system that accurately predicts where over-policing will occur is \"accurate\"\n- A system that reinforces existing inequalities can be \"validated\"\n- A system that efficiently targets marginalized communities is \"effective\"\n\n**But:**\n\n- Is it just?\n- Is it equitable?\n- Does it make communities safer?\n- Does it address root causes?\n- Or does it just
